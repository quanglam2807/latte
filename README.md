**[Latte](https://latte.quanglam2807.com)** - Distraction-Free Daily News Briefing.

**master** branch only includes the source code of Latte 2 & up. For older versions, check out the **legacy-** branches.

Are you tired with news websites: obnoxious ads, "breaking news", auto-play videos, pumping megabytes of crap into your browser, lack of privacy, and lack of citations?

Latte gives you access to quality daily news briefing from Wikipedia once per day at 8 PM PST.

It's encrypted. There's no ads. It loads super fast. Your activity isn't logged. It's boring & non-addictive.
