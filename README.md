**master** branch only includes the source code of Latte v3 & up. For older versions, check out the **legacy-** branches.

Are you tired with news websites: obnoxious ads, "breaking news", auto-play videos, pumping megabytes of crap into your browser, lack of privacy, and lack of citations?

Latte delivers quality news briefing from Wikipedia directly to your email inbox once per day at 3 AM GMT.

There's no ads. It loads super fast. Your activity isn't logged. It's boring & non-addictive.
